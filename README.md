# Teammate Revival

## Description:
Survivors can revive their fallen colleagues, but it comes at the price of their own health. A skull marks where the player died. Stand within the circle to begin, but stay at your own risk ;)

## To Do:
* Allow an interaction to start reviving a player (rather than automatically starting when inside the circle.
* Add customizability / config
* Make circle more visible
* Test it on the real network rather than only on splitscreen


## Change Notes:

* 2.0.0
    * Major visual update
        * A red-lit skull marks the place of death
        * An 'X' marker visible through any terrain now shows above the skull.
        * Dynamic lighting queues how close the player is to revival.
        * A circle on the ground shows the range you must stay in to continue reviving your teammate.
    * Fixed Bugs:
        * Fixed a bug that caused hundreds of Null Reference Exceptions
        * Made it so the player list is only populated once, unless new players join the game.
        * Mod must now be downloaded by each player.
    * Removed many unnecissary logs.
    * Miscelaneous changes to the system.
        

* 1.0.6
    * Made it so it actually works this time (WOW!)
    * Added a skull that hovers over a player's location on death (this is used as the revival point)
    * Made health drain from the reviving player and add onto the dead player (speed depends on player level)
    * Still lots of bugs and polish and visual changes that need to be added!

* 1.0.5
    * Hopefully fixed players being able to revive themselves
    * (I didn't fix it it broke the entire thing... yay)

    * Got mod actually working
    * Bugs:
