# Teammate Revival - WARNING HEAVY WIP

### Allows survivors to revive their fallen colleagues. But be careful, you can't fight and revive at the same time. 


## Current Function:
    * Teammates can walk in range of a dead player to start a countdown. 
       When the countdown is up the player will revive.
    * Revival range and time customizable in the config.

## To Do:
    * Stop players from being able to attack while reviving a teammate
    * Require an interaction to start reviving a player (rather than starting when in range)
    * Add a health drain feature (drain most of your health to revive your friend)
    * Add option to disable reviving during boss battle / while in combat
    * Must add MAJOR visual polish and queues
        * Possibly an animation for the reviver as well if possible


## Change Notes:

* 1.0.5
    * Hopefully fixed players being able to revive themselves

* 1.0.4
    * Got mod actually working
    *Bugs:
