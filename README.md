# Teammate Revival - HEAVY WIP

### Allows survivors to revive their fallen colleagues. But it comes at the price of your own health. 
When you walk into range of a dead survivor's skull, your health will transfer to the dead survivor (with a speed based on level, and stopping at 10%) until the survivor has taken 50 health from you. 
They will then revive. Range can be changed in config.



## To Do:
* Allow an interaction to start reviving a player (rather than automatically starting when in range)
* Add option to disable reviving during boss battle / while in combat
* Must add MAJOR polish and visual queues
    * Possibly an animation for the reviver as well, if possible


## Change Notes:

* 1.0.6
    * Made it so it actually works this time (WOW!)
    * Added a skull that hovers over a player's location on death (this is used as the revival point)
    * Made health drain from the reviving player and add onto the dead player (speed depends on player level)
    * Still lots of bugs and polish and visual changes that need to be added!

* 1.0.5
    * Hopefully fixed players being able to revive themselves
    * (I didn't fix it it broke the entire thing... yay)

* 1.0.4
    * Got mod actually working
    *Bugs:
        *Players can revive themselves after they die :|
        *not ready to play yet

* 1.0.3
    * fixed versioning

* 1.0.2
    * Fixed a few problems (still not functional yet)

* 1.0.1:
    * Fixed typos
    * updated artwork

* 1.0.0:
    * Initial "release" (not really a release but, eh)
